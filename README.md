1. Credit Card Fraud Detection Using KNN Algorithm
The fundamental objective of the project is to build a default prevention model to help banks
identify customers with high probability of defaulting to improve their bottom line. The algorithm
of choice for this project is K-Nearest-Neighbours (KNN). The model had a 91% precision and 79%
accuracy, all this was done in R using RStudio.
